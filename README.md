# **Exam Mentor**

**Exam Mentor** is an adaptive learning platform that dynamically generates questions tailored to a student's progress. It supports multiple domains, allowing course creators to define structured courses while leveraging AI-generated content.

## **Architecture Overview**

Exam Mentor consists of three main components:

1. **Frontend (Course Builder & Student Interface)**
   - **Built with:** React (TypeScript)
   - **Purpose:** 
     - **Course Builder:** Allows course creators to define courses, chapters, and questions.
     - **Student Interface:** Provides an adaptive learning experience with dynamically generated questions.

2. **Backend (Rust)**
   - **Built with:** Axum, SQLx, PostgreSQL
   - **Purpose:** 
     - Manages course definitions, tracks student progress, and fetches AI-generated questions.
     - Provides APIs for both students and course creators.

3. **Model Service (Python)**
   - **Built with:** FastAPI, LlamaIndex, LangChain
   - **Purpose:** 
     - Uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to fetch relevant context before generating questions.
     - Leverages a **local LLM** (e.g., Mistral, LLaMA) for fine-tuned question generation.

## **Component Breakdown**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend**
- **Course Builder**
  - Define courses, chapters, and seed questions.
  - Publish courses for students.

- **Student Interface**
  - Displays adaptive questions.
  - Tracks student progress.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Backend (Rust)**
- **Endpoints**
  - `/courses` ‚Üí Manage courses.
  - `/chapters` ‚Üí Organize chapters.
  - `/generate_question/{course_id}` ‚Üí Fetch dynamically generated questions.

- **Database (PostgreSQL)**
  - Stores courses, chapters, and seed questions.
  - Tracks student progress.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Service (Python)**
#### **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Workflow**  
The **RAG** approach ensures that dynamically generated questions are accurate and contextually relevant by leveraging a **vector database** to retrieve domain-specific knowledge before generating a response.

1. **Retrieve relevant course content** ‚Üí The system searches the vector database for the most relevant text passages based on the course topic and the student's progress.  
2. **Generate new questions** ‚Üí The retrieved content is fed into the model, which formulates multiple-choice questions tailored to the learner's skill level.  
3. **Return AI-generated multiple-choice questions** ‚Üí The backend delivers a structured question with plausible answer choices, ensuring an adaptive and engaging learning experience.  

#### **Vector Database**
- Stores structured course content, seed questions, and relevant knowledge snippets for different domains.  
- Ensures the LLM generates factually correct and context-aware questions by providing high-quality context before question generation.  
- Enhances adaptability by allowing fine-tuning based on course-specific data, making each course unique to its subject matter.

## **Future Enhancements**
- ‚úÖ **Fine-Tuning Option** ‚Üí Allow clients to train their own models.
- ‚úÖ **Adaptive Learning Model** ‚Üí Dynamically adjust difficulty based on user performance.
- ‚úÖ **Support for More Question Formats** ‚Üí Add image-based, video-based, and open-ended questions.
